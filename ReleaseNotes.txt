EigenExa Release Notes

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.12 : Octorber 25, 2022)
  * [Serious] Bug fix for a very rare condensed clustering case of
    eigenmodes. Modified the deflation couting correctly.
  * Modify the benchmark options to check the specific kernel.
  * Modify the collective communication algorithms.

2.11 : December 1, 2021)
  * [Upgrade] Experimental support for Hermite solver, namely, eigen_h.
  * [Serious] Fix the numerical error happened to be included in v2.10,
    where the tall-skinny QR coded in eigen_prd_t4x.F of eigen_sx was
    too sensitive to treat tiny values and forced-double truncation.
    But, it might depend on the compiler version and the code generator.
  * Modify pointer attribution to 'allocatable' to avoid automatic
    deallocation on the exit of callee routines.
  * Some code modifications are applied to pass strong debugging tools
    with respect to Fortran 95 and some of Fortran 2003 extensions.
  * Fix some bugs, for exmaple, missing private attribution to some
    variables for OpenMP.

2.10 : October 17, 2021)
  * [Serious] Bug fix for violation of the result of allreduce in DC.
    It happened very rarely when data to be transferred was shorter
    than the number of processes participating.
  * [Serious] Bug fix for inconsistent API interpretation of DLAED4,
    when K is less than or equal to 2. This bug happened when a lot
    of deflations are carried out, and sub-matrices are shrunk tiny as 1
    or 2. So, it is infrequent to see.
  * [Serious] Bug fix for non-deterministic behavior of the DC branch,
    which happened if an uninitialized variable referred in the brach
    condition, and is affected by the side-effects of other modules,
    etc. It was fixed when 2.9 was released but noted in the release.
  * Reduce the internal data capacity in the TRD and DC routines.
  * Fix the installation of Fortran modules.

2.9  : September 24, 2021)
  * Modify the flops count precise in DC kernels.

    notice was stated in User's manual for version 2.6).

2.6 : November 1, 2020
  * Reduced the generation of MPI communicator in the divide and conquer
    algorithm routine.
  * Changed calling MPI_Allreduce from the subroutine of MPI library to
    an in-house/hand-written subroutine equaling the MPI functions due to
    the violation of numerical reproducibility in some MPI implementations.
  * Fix module dependencies.

2.5 : August 1, 2019
  * Refine the data distribution in the divide and conquer algorithm routine.

2.4b : August 20, 2018
  * [Serious] Bug fix for incorrect data redistribution, which might
    violate allocated memory.
    The bug might have happened in the case that the number of processes,
    P=Px*Py, is large, and Px and Py are not equal but nearly equal.
  * This version is for only bug fix for the serious one.

  * Communication Avoiding algorithms to the eigen_s driver.
  * The optional argument nvec is available, which specifies the number of
    eigenvectors to be computed from the smallest. This version does not
    employ the special algorithm to reduce the computational cost. It only
    drops off the unneccessary eigenmodes in the backtransformation.

2.3d : July 07, 2015
  * Tuned up the parameters according to target architectures.
  * Introduce a sort routine in bisect.F and bisect2.F for eigenvalues.
